# Working with ERA5land data with the stars R library 

This repo contains a basic example of a R-based workflow for data management
and analysis of ERA5land data with the stars package. Example data and 
[Rmd report](report/ERA5land_stars.html) are included in the repo. Steps include:

1. Reading data
2. Stacking data
3. Aggregating data by space and time
4. Plotting data
5. Transforming data to another CRS using GDAL
6. Extracting pixel values via intersection
